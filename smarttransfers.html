      <h2>Problem to solve</h2>
      <p>
        Having multiple bank accounts and getting your finances in order takes time, continuous efforts and discipline. Moving money around between multiple accounts while using different banking apps doesn’t make it easier. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When I joined this project, the above problem was already defined and validated with early adopters; freelancers. My role was to help creating experiments to define and strengthen the core features to match this solution to our target audience. Once found I had to translate these requirements into a well validated solution in the form of a MVP, which should be used during the next phase (Solution Fit).

      <h2>Process to solution</h2>
      <p>
      Together with the validation expert we used rapid prototyping over three iterations to define the concept around the following core features:
      </p>
    
      <ol>
        <li>Defining how smart the automatic transfers should be</li>
        <li>What are the most valuable automatic transfers for our early adopters?</li>
        <li>What is the best way to set up this kind of automatic transfer?</li>
      </ol>
    
    </div>

        During this rapid prototyping sessions we converged per iteration to get a better picture of the core features. I created the prototypes in Sketch & InVision, the validation expert arranged the participants. The first round was used to understand how ‘smart’ the automatic transfer should be to have value. Plus we were exploring multiple styles of creating this automatic transfers in the form of a ‘smart rule’.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the second round I created prototypes around the IFTTT structure, a proven solution and this style stood out in our previous testing. I created journeys for six rule templates and one to create your own rule.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last round we improved upon the rule templates itself and I did minor tweaks to the InVision prototype.

      <h2>Validation: Defining the Solution</h2>
      <p>
        At this stage we had a pretty good understanding of the added value. Now it was time to improve the experience, to set up a smart transfer rule without any hassle. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To bring the concept forward, I had to take a step back and make the team aware that we had to further analyse the interaction for setting up a rule. Strong discussions rose about continuing with our current ‘wireframes’ or dedicate a testing round to fine-tune this interaction. I highly advised the latter because we just went with our initial idea, tested only on a computer, and I had the feeling that we could take this concept to the next level by spending time on this interaction.       </p>

        <h2>Iterating on design via comparative testing</h2>

        <p>
          Firstly, I created the above overview of the rule structure that we wanted to implement, inspired from the IFTTT structure. With Sketch and InVision I created two different prototypes of the same journey. One interaction was based on our previous prototypes, the dropdown variant. The other variant is what we called the ‘sentence variant’. I designed this interaction based around a sentence (the rule) which you create word by word and my assumption was that it would be more intuitive for the user.       </p>

    <div class="my-5 text-xl-start">
      <p>
        From this point we moved towards the sentence variant, users had a better overview and thought the sentence variant was more refreshing. To iterate on this design I’ve hosted a remote design studio in Miro with the whole team, including engineers to further ideate on possible scenario’s of which the outcome you’ll see below.

      <h2>Comparative testing to explore more options</h2>
      <p>
        From the design studio and previous testing, two new versions were designed. Both versions A and B were comparative tested by participants, I found this important so the participant could compare both versions, highlighting the pro’s and con’s and pick a winner. After every version a set of questions was asked along with System Usability Score form, so I could quantify a ‘better’ version and bring this back to the team.

      <p>
        After testing both versions, to my surprise, the majority chose Prototype B over A. Mainly because it was more simple and easy to use, even though A showed itself to be simple, intuitive and fun. Participants still needed to think a bit more. I was surprised because of how they reacted (emotionally) during these observations. I would have bet on prototype A.

        <h2>One last round of testing</h2>
        <p>
          Because of this interesting outcome, I iterated on the designs and merged the likings of both versions. In short, I used the step-by-step principle (Prototype B) to build a sentence/rule (Prototype A). Furthermore I updated the UI, based upon the styling of the website (at that time) to match the styling between products.
        </p>
        <p>
          All this resulted in a last MVP InVision Prototype where everything comes together. <br><br>The prototype is embedded and is clickable.

      Before I handed my work over for the next phase, I wanted to put in one last round of validation to validate all the learnings. During these tests all participants were able to create a rule, found it intuitive and quick and only small details emerged for improvements. Which made me satisfied and confident about the strengths and uniqueness of this concept. 
    </p>
      <p>
        It’s pretty nice to see where we came from and how this concept changed over time. The validation of this last prototype was the end of the Problem Fit and for me on this project. I handed over all the insights and designs to an UI Designer who brought this concept to the next level, as you can see in the hero and mockups below.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rabobank decided to merge this concept into their own app. Since Q4 2021 an altered version is available to all Rabobank customers in their marketplace.
